# MDCII

Another 1602 AD project. However, the focus here is not on reading the original files, but on creating an editable
isometric game world.

The original game is needed. In the `config.ini` the paths must be adapted.

For a program start so called tile atlas graphics are needed, which have to be created first. For this purpose the
`TileAtlasCreator` is located in the `install` directory.

**The first start takes longer, because the `haeuser.cod` will be parsed.**

**19.01.2023** The project includes a new island generator that can create an island based on Perlin Noise.
The class is in a very early stage of development, so we shouldn't expect too much right now. An example of an
island created with Seed 1276 and a Frequency of 0.102 can be seen here:

## Build

### Requirements

* [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
* [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
* [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)
* [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)
* [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
* [Magic Enum C++](https://github.com/Neargye/magic_enum)
* [FreeType](https://freetype.org/)
* [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf)
* C++ 17 Compiler

### Platforms

* Win with Visual Studio and Premake
* Win with MinGW64 (Gcc/Cmake)
* Linux

### Build instructions

Setting up a C++ project is always a pain. A few notes for the following explanations:

- First, [install](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/installation.html) the Conan package manager locally.
- Always use the *latest Conan package manager*.
- The Conan profile should always specify the *correct version of the compiler*.
- On Linux, the Conan profile should *configure the package manager* to install any missing system packages.
- Especially on Windows with MinGW it is important that `gcc` and `cmake` are *in the path*.
- It might be a good idea to use a newer or other version of ImGui or Protocol Buffers. It's not (for now)!
Additional things would have to be changed for this.

#### Win with Visual Studio 2022 and Premake 5

The Conan profile should look like this:

```txt
[settings]
os=Windows
os_build=Windows
arch=x86_64
arch_build=x86_64
compiler=Visual Studio
compiler.version=16
build_type=Release
[options]
[build_requires]
[env]
```

As this project relies on multiple 3rd-Party Libs, I created a `conanfile_win.txt` with all the requirements.

```txt
[requires]
glfw/3.3.7
glew/2.2.0
glm/0.9.9.8
spdlog/1.10.0
imgui/1.86
magic_enum/0.8.0
freetype/2.12.1
protobuf/3.21.1
gtest/1.12.1

[generators]
premake
```

My favor build configuration tool for Windows is Premake5. Premake5 can generate Makefiles and Visual Studio Solutions with a single description file for cross-platform projects.
Download [Premake5](https://premake.github.io/download) to your preferred location.

Complete the installation of requirements for the project running:

```bash
$ conan install conanfile_win.txt -s build_type=Debug
```

or

```bash
$ conan install conanfile_win.txt -s build_type=Release
```

followed by:

```bash
$ premake5 vs2022
```


#### Win with MinGW64 (Gcc/Cmake)

The Conan profile should look like this:

```txt
[settings]
os=Windows
os_build=Windows
arch=x86_64
arch_build=x86_64
compiler=gcc
compiler.version=11.2
compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11
build_type=Release
[options]
[build_requires]
[env]
```

I created a `conanfile.txt` with all the requirements.

```txt
[requires]
glfw/3.3.7
glew/2.2.0
glm/0.9.9.8
spdlog/1.10.0
imgui/1.86
magic_enum/0.8.0
freetype/2.12.1
protobuf/3.21.1
gtest/1.12.1

[generators]
cmake
```

Complete the installation of requirements for the project running:

```bash
$ conan install conanfile.txt -s build_type=Debug --build missing
```

or

```bash
$ conan install conanfile.txt -s build_type=Release --build missing
```

If another profile (e.g. `default_mingw`) is used, this can be specified with:

```bash
$ conan install conanfile.txt -s build_type=Debug --build missing --profile default_mingw
```


#### Linux

A Conan profile is created as follows:

```bash
$ conan profile new default --detect  # Generates default profile detecting GCC and sets old ABI
```

If you are using GCC compiler >= 5.1, Conan will set the `compiler.libcxx` to the old ABI for backwards compatibility. You can change this with the following commands:

```bash
$ conan profile update settings.compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11 default  # Sets libcxx to C++11 ABI
```

For my Debian system the profile looks like this. The package manager must be configured by yourself.

```txt
[settings]
os=Linux
os_build=Linux
arch=x86_64
arch_build=x86_64
compiler=gcc
compiler.version=10
compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11
build_type=Release

[options]

[build_requires]

[env]

[conf]
tools.system.package_manager:tool=apt-get
tools.system.package_manager:mode=install
tools.system.package_manager:sudo=True
```

I created a `conanfile.txt` with all the requirements.

```txt
[requires]
glfw/3.3.7
glew/2.2.0
glm/0.9.9.8
spdlog/1.10.0
imgui/1.86
magic_enum/0.8.0
freetype/2.12.1
protobuf/3.21.1
gtest/1.12.1

[generators]
cmake
```

Complete the installation of requirements for the project running:

```bash
$ conan install conanfile.txt -s build_type=Debug --build missing
```

or

```bash
$ conan install conanfile.txt -s build_type=Release --build missing
```

**If the following error occurs: `ERROR: opengl/system: Error in package_info() method, line 83`, then `pkg-config` must be installed first.**

```bash
$ sudo apt install pkg-config
```

**It may be also necessary to install the following packages.**

```bash
$ sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-dev
```

```bash
$ sudo apt install libglu1-mesa-dev
```

Build with:

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ cd src/bin
$ ./MDCII
```
