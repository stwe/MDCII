# MDCII

Another unofficial 1602 AD project. However, the focus here is not on reading the original files, but on creating an editable
isometric game world.

You must have a copy of the original game installed on your computer.

[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/50ffb066523c4064ab513bef2f8d4628)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/stwe/MDCII/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=stwe/MDCII&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

**Here I replaced my own render engine with the OlcPixelGameEngine 2.x. This makes rendering much easier.
In addition, many dependencies on other libraries could be removed.**
